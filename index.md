I am an Electrical engineering student at CSUF and I intend to graduate in 2028.

## Favortie CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1

  This was a great lab because it was an amazing introduction to coding. We were able to change the Hello World program to say our names. It set the foundation for future labs. 

* Lab 2

  Although Lab 1 was a great intro, Lab 2 was where I felt proud of a full page of coding. Using cout and cin to create messages was amazing. It really made me feel like a true coder. 

* Lab 4, Part 2

  This was my favorite lab because I am a huge fan of video games! It was super fun to create my very own game through the Hilo game. It was a simple game, but in the end, you could make better games in the long run.
